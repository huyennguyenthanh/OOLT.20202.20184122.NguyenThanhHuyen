ICT's societal and economic impact
ICT is leveraged for economic, societal and interpersonal transactions and interactions. 
ICT has drastically changed how people work, communicate, learn and live. 
Moreover, ICT continues to revolutionize all parts of the human experience as first computers and now robots do many of the tasks once handled by humans. 
For example, computers once answered phones and directed calls to the appropriate individuals to respond; 
now robots not only can answer the calls, but they can often more quickly and efficiently handle callers' requests for services.


ICT's importance to economic development and business growth has been so monumental, 
in fact, that it's credited with ushering in what many have labeled the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

ICT also underpins broad shifts in society, as individuals en masse are moving from personal, 
face-to-face interactions to ones in the digital space. This new era is frequently termed the Digital Age.


For all its revolutionary aspects, though, ICT capabilities aren't evenly distributed. 
Simply put, richer countries and richer individuals enjoy more access and thus have a greater ability to seize on the advantages and opportunities powered by ICT.

Consider, for example, some findings from the World Bank. In 2016, it stated that more than 75% of people worldwide have access to a cellphone. 
However, internet access through either mobile or fixed broadband remains prohibitively expensive in many countries due to a lack of ICT infrastructure. 
Furthermore, the World Bank estimated that out of the global population of 7.4 billion people, more than 4 billion don't have access to the internet. 
Additionally, it estimated that only 1.1 billion people have access to high-speed internet.

In the United States and elsewhere, this discrepancy in access to ICT has created the so-called digital divide.
